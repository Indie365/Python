"""
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique used
commonly as a data preprocessing step in unsupervised and supervised machine learning pipelines.
The principle behind PCA is the reduction in the number of variables in the dataset, while
preserving as much as information as possible.

Here, the  principal components represent the directions of the data that explain a
maximal amount of variance. Here, the data is projected onto a new coordinate system
such that the direction cqpturing the largest variation in data can be easily identified.

This implementation of PCA consists of the following steps:
1. Data Standardization (Z-score Normalization): This step involved the centering of the
data by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation
so that it has unit variance.

2. Covariance Matrix Calculation: This step involved the calculation of the covariance matrix
of the standardized data. The covariance matrix allows us to measure how different
features vary together, capturing the relationships between them.

3. Singular Value Decomposition: In this step, we use Singular Value Decomposition or SVD to
Decomposes the covariance matrix into its singular eignvectors and singular eigenvalues,
 which help identify the principal components.

4. Selection of Principal Components: Here, we choose the top k principal components
that explain the most variance in the data.

5. Projection of Data: Here, we transform the original standardized data into
the new lower-dimensional space defined by the selected principal components.
