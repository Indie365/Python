Project Euler Problem: https://projecteuler.net/problem=95

An amicable chain is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the
proper divisors of the previous one, and the chain eventually returns to the
starting number. The problem is to find the smallest member of the longest
amicable chain under a given limit.

In this implementation, we aim to identify all amicable chains and find the
one with the maximum length, while also returning the smallest member of that
chain.
